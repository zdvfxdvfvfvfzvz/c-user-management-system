---

## âœ¨ Key Features

### 1. **Intelligent Typo Correction (Levenshtein Distance Algorithm)**
The system uses edit distance calculation to find reviews even with typos!

**Try These Searches:**
- Search `"jhon"` â†’ Finds "John Doe" âœ“
- Search `"sara"` â†’ Finds "Sarah Wilson" âœ“
- Search `"poom apirk"` â†’ Finds "Poom Apirak" âœ“
- Search `"somcai"` â†’ Finds "Somchai Wong" âœ“
- Search `"peter paker"` â†’ Finds "Peter Parker" âœ“

**How It Works:**
- Calculates minimum edits needed to transform one string to another
- Distance 0 = Exact match
- Distance 1-2 = Close match (likely typo)
- Distance 3 = Similar name (fuzzy match)
- Uses dynamic programming with 2D matrix (O(mÃ—n) complexity)

### 2. **Thai Buddhist Era (à¸ž.à¸¨.) Support**
Accepts both Gregorian (CE) and Buddhist Era (BE) dates!

**Valid Date Examples:**
- `2025-12-25` (CE) âœ“
- `2568-12-25` (BE = 2025 + 543) âœ“
- `2400-2700` (BE range) âœ“
- `1900-2100` (CE range) âœ“

**Invalid Dates Rejected:**
- `2568-13-01` (month > 12) âœ—
- `2025-02-30` (invalid day) âœ—
- `9999-99-99` (out of range) âœ—
